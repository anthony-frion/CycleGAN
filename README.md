# CycleGAN
A hands-on tutorial for using pre-trained CycleGAN models.

The notebook is designed to be used in Google Colab, which you can use for free : https://colab.research.google.com/
It is intended to be usable even if you have very little experiene in machine learning. If you have any issues or want to contact me for whatever reason, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail at the following adress : anthony.frion@imt-atlantique.net

You can check out the paper's website here : https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/

In particular, you can dive further into CycleGAN by trying to train your own model with the authors' code : https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN
